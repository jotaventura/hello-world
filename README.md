This is the first repository and where I'll put some tests and exercices

Hi stranger,

I've been, for so long, in love for computers e how the tech can help us every day. I was a civil engineer and, see some thing what I help to build beeing useful, make me happy.
I really don't know if is too late to me, I'm 34 years old and I've been depressed for 3 years. Now I hope I found what what can challenge me every day.
